# What is CSAM
     CSAM [ Child Sexual Abuse Material ]

**CSAM** refers to any visual depiction (real or fictional) that portrays real children or characters designed to resemble children in sexual situations or engaged in explicit conduct. 

Under U.S. federal law *(18 U.S.C. §§ 2256 [(^)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2256), 1466A[(^)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1466A), and the PROTECT Act[(^)](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-108publ21/pdf/PLAW-108publ21.pdf))*, even _non-photographic_ representations, such as "**loli**," "**shota**," or "**cub**" content can be classified as CSAM if they are considered obscene or show the sexual abuse or exploitation of children.

Improperly reporting CSAM to PixelTail has led to **permanent bans** for distribution and possession, even if your intent was good. If you encounter **CSAM** in Tower Unite - **DO NOT SCREENSHOT IT IN A PIXELTAIL REPORT**. Possessing CSAM even for reporting purposes is illegal, as is distributing it to PixelTails servers through a report. 

# Properly Reporting in Tower Unite

Immediately report it to "National Center for Missing & Exploited Children" (**NCMEC**) [(^)](https://report.cybertip.org/) regardless of the severity of the content, one image is enough to justify reporting. Don't assume it has to be graphic or real to qualify. 

Describe in detail:
- Platform (Tower Unite).
- The **exact time**, including time zone.
- The **condo name**.
- The **STEAMID64** and Username.
- Write what you saw, non-graphic language.
- **Then** report it to PixelTail, letting them know you **reported the material to NCMEC.**

NCMEC has internal tools and law enforcement access. They will be able to subpoena PixelTail for logs, screenshots, or hosted content.

If you are unsure whether what you saw qualifies as CSAM, **report it anyway**. **NCMEC** will evaluate the report with law enforcement. <br>**You** are not legally expected to provide proof, only a credible, non-graphic, report. The **NCMEC** accepts **anonymous** submissions and will log your tip, potentially issuing a formal notice to PixelTail Games.




# PixelTails Obligation
A player report regarding CSAM does not count as an obligation alone to act upon, PixelTail are legally only obligated to act the moment they become "aware" - by reviewing the report discreetly, through logs, in-game inspection, or reasonably suspects it themselves. <br>
Or when NCMEC or law enforcement notifies them. <br>They must then **immediately preserve the content** for 90 days (logs, uploads, access metadata) per federal law in case law enforcement needs it. Destroying or **ignoring it** is illegal. 

> Under U.S. federal law , any provider of an
> “electronic communication service must report child
> sexual abuse material (CSAM) to the **National Center for Missing &
> Exploited Children (NCMEC)** as soon as they become aware of it.

PixelTail must immediately restrict access to the reported content, preventing any further distribution or reuploads. This includes permanently banning any accounts involved in uploading or distributing CSAM. They are also required to report back to NCMEC with any relevant data they have concerning the incident.

PixelTail **is** legally obligated to report child sexual abuse material to the **NCMEC**.
Failure to report can result in fines of up to $300,000 per incident or criminal charges in severe cases. <br>

*This system was breached during January 2020 to around August 2021 when players hosting child pornography were given permanent condo listing bans **which did not work as intended** - as there was a bypass that allowed continued **hosting of illegal content in friends-only** condos.*

*The hosts would 'friend-request' other players to view their galleries in **secret**. PixelTail was aware of this loophole as it was during a time PixelTail allowed players to self-moderate their condos by defaulting all moderation bans to **OFF**. In turn, allowing pedophile content to be distrubuted in private. <br> PixelTail silenced and shadow banned players requests asking the developers to tackle the pedo situation, and only started taking action once players started leaving negative reviews, while many threatened legal action.*  [(^)](https://dubugc.github.io/towerbans/2025/06/26/Tackling-the-Pedophilic-Content.html)

# Your Obligation

Your obligation after reporting is to request confirmation that PixelTail will comply with mandatory reporting laws by forwarding the report to NCMEC. As required by U.S. federal law (18 U.S.C. § 2258A) [(^)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2258A).



Under extreme cases, If PixelTail **ignores** your message, **silences** players who raise the alarm, and/or **refuses** to confirm reporting, you can escalate it by reporting the platforms **inaction** to NCMEC again and consider notifying the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center, [(^)](https://www.ic3.gov/) as it now becomes a matter of criminal negligence.

**They are legally obligated to report all CSAM if they are aware of it.**
