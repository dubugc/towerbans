## 1. Private Ban List
In 2024, we discovered that a select group of players had access to what looked like a **private moderation feed** - a live log showing who was banned or muted, for how long, and why.  
These individuals weren’t staff, but they acted like it. Operating in closed Discord channels, they used this insider information to shape perception, deliver warnings, and socially enforce rules, knowing when someone was banned before the player knew themselves. It fed into the illusion of being unofficial moderators.

PixelTail told us the data can be accessed publicly, and didn't seem too concerned about players having access to the **moderation feed** when we brought this to their attention.

Nobody knew it existed. <br> We decided to make it _actually_ public.

## 2. Public Ban List
That’s when the **Tower Unite Bans** project was born.
I worked with Boyardee to create a tool that turned raw ban data into an hourly-updating thread on Steam. 

The original holders of the data realised just 4 days later they weren't the only ones with access now. The ones who usually operate in locked Discord channels suddenly were forced to share the information with regular players and have their power diluted.

So they tattled to MacDGuy.

Instead of reaching out to us, MacDGuy reported the list to Valve to have the group taken down. <br> We managed to reinstate the group, under Steam Supports condition that the contents of the threads were to be deleted, as *someone* had reported the contents as being a **hit list on Tower Unite players.** LOL

## Retaliation
Months passed. The group went dormant after we stopped publicly updating it.

I went back to building condos - until I was permanently condo banned. And I wasn't the only one. <br> A wave of bans hit at the *exact same time*, like some coordinated ICE raid. Amongst these names was **Chef Boyardee** - hit with a permanent mute and, bizarrely, a media ban.

Boyardee was always just my backend dev for the group, once the tool was built and the group was taken down by Valve, he moved on. 
He wasn’t in the game when the ban happened. He's never *opened* the game. **Boyardee doesn't even own the game.**
