Tower Unite used to have a **major pedophilia problem**. 

We're talking **lolicon**, **shotacon**, **cub art**, and **real underage content** hosted in players condos. 
Moderation was slow to ban them, and many in the community recommended leaving bad reviews to point out the pedo problem to unsuspecting buyers. Others warned that even *talking about* the problem could lead to ***in-game mutes***, feeding a perception that the developers were more focused on silencing discussion than removing the content.

Eventually, these players hosting the material *were* banned - but only after multiple reports. Yet the cycle continued. New condos with the same content kept appearing. **Youâ€™d unknowingly walk into one and suddenly be staring at CP**, because there were no 18+ tags or family filters.

It created the illusion that every condo potentially had porn in it, and Tower Unite was quietly becoming known as _the porn game_. Predators could do whatever they wanted, while everyone else was told to **ignore it**.

Then someone finally had enough.

## ðŸ“œ Glaots Review

In **July 2021**, a player named **Glaot** posted a brutal but well-received Steam review calling out PixelTail for ignoring cub content. [(^)](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198018705097/recommended/394690/)

He pointed out how PixelTail had done nothing to stem the growing number of pedo condos. The players hosting these condos were eventually banned, but it wasnâ€™t enough, these condos kept coming back. [(^)](https://i.imgur.com/mdMTDDg.png)

Gloat foreshadowed the future of moderation, the only way this ends is by **limiting players creative freedom** and **harsher penalties than just condo listing bans.** He wanted more moderation, because what we had wasnâ€™t working.

## ðŸ§© Moderation Loophole 

Moderation worked differently between **January 2020 [0.8.8.1]** to around **August 2021 [0.14.3.0]**. <br> Bans issued by PixelTail *only* applied to the Plaza. Developers made it clear that condos were *not* moderated, it was up to the player to manage their own spaces using the in-game tools provided, if they wished. <br>The key issue was that **server hosts had to manually opt-in** to enforce the official banlist in their condos, and many didn't realise this feature existed.

<div style="text-align:center;">

This meant that players banned by PixelTail for harassment, racism or distributing underage content, were still seen hanging around in public condos. Some even became recognisable by the community. And when they were no longer in the publics eye, they were regrouping on Steam with likeminded players, **hosting friends-only condos** where they continued sharing the same content.  <br>
Because the moderation at the time took no clear stance, these spaces became lawless by design. It wasn't that certain material was allowed or disallowed, it just wasn't touched. PixelTail left it up to the players while they worked on the Plaza, which meant illegal and highly disturbing content could continue circulating without oversight, depending entirely on the host's personal boundaries.


This led to the widespread perception that bans meant nothing and that reports werenâ€™t being acted on. But they were. Players just found a **loophole**, and for over a year, it allowed predators to operate with no consequences.

## ðŸ§¨Forced Moderation

Glaotâ€™s negative review started gaining traction in **July 2021** and PixelTail finally took notice of players concerns about illegal content. This prompted **MacDGuy** to announce immediate moderation changes, which may have been the first step PixelTail has taken in combatting underage content.

From that point on:
-   Permanently banned users couldnâ€™t host _any_ condo.
-   Permanently muted users were muted _across all servers_.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9GMJrbq.png" width="600" /> </a> </div>

This effectively pulled the plug on how predators operated in Tower Unite. But the devs never openly admitted that pedophilia was the reason. <br> Officially, it was about consistency. **Caboose** said, If someone was banned then they should be banned **everywhere**. If you had a chat ban, you shouldnâ€™t just hop into someoneâ€™s condo and continue harassing people.

But anyone paying attention knew exactly what it was really about.




## ðŸŽ­ Canvas Safety Settings Loophole

Within that same month of being informed of moderation changes, a new system was introduced: **Canvas Safety Settings**. [0.14.3.0] [(^)](https://steamcommunity.com/games/394690/announcements/detail/4150616678123695660)

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0kdpMVL.png" width="400" /> </a> </div>

Canvases were now **blank by default**. You had to *"click-to-continue"*, before any images would load, a precaution meant to stop players from accidentally viewing  canvas content the moment they entered a condo. But it hinged entirely on trusting the host.

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <a href="https://i.imgur.com/BTpumZK.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

The biggest issue was that **many of these condos werenâ€™t labelled 18+ in the first place**.  
There were no rules requiring hosts to do so either. You could still walk into a publicly listed, family-friendly condo, trust the host and later be met with **pornography** of any type, exactly like before. <br> The only thing PixelTail changed was who took the blame now. *You clicked it.*






## ðŸ–•Mature Content System

<div style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://i.imgur.com/CKOTMZg.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/tQhWAF7.png" width="800" /> </a> </div>

The updates to hinder illicit condos were just not working until **October 2024**.

PixelTail introduced actual real restrictions to control the flood of sexual content in public condos - *nearly 8 years after launch*. <br>The update made all **18+ condos hidden by default**, slapped on **warning labels**, and forced players to manually **opt-in** just to see them.

<div style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://i.imgur.com/CKOTMZg.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/CKOTMZg.png" width="600" /> </a> </div>

---

This is something that should have been implemented nearly a decade ago. The reasoning for PixelTail putting it off for as long as they could was due to wanting to keep a neutral stance on mature content in their game. But players started to complain too loudly through negative reviews, and many talked about Tower Unite getting sued into oblivion once news articles found out what was going on.
