title: Complete List of Bannable Rules
permalink: /rules/
---

Regardless of prior offences, the usage of racist slurs will get you **permanently banned.** <br>No warnings, **instant ban**.

All rules listed have been officially stated by Pixeltail Staff on their Forums, Discord, in-game, email replies, Terms of Service and Moderation appeals. <br>Some rules are not disclosed and only become known after someone is banned and comes forward, indicating potential abuse of moderation. <br> However, according to their EULA, they retain full authority to terminate your access, restrict features, and enforce penalties at any time, with or without explanation, notification, or recourse. This grants them unchecked power over your account and content, regardless of transparency or fairness.

PixelTail reserves the right to terminate your license to use the game at any time, **without cause, warning, or refund**.
You can lose access for **off-platform behaviour**, even if it isn‚Äôt explicitly listed as a violation.

The phrase _‚Äúat our discretion‚Äù_ means they don‚Äôt need to follow set criteria or **provide logs, context, or justification**.

PixelTail can **mute you, restrict features, or block functionality** without actually banning your account. There‚Äôs **no requirement** for fairness, consistency, or transparency.

The term _‚Äúobjectionable‚Äù_ is **deliberately vague**, allowing the devs to delete content **even if it doesn‚Äôt violate any specific rule**.

If something breaks, causes loss, or harms you while using their platform, **PixelTail disclaims nearly all liability.**

They are **not obligated to inform users** when the End User License Agreement is updated ‚Äî changes can happen silently and be enforced immediately. [(^)](https://store.steampowered.com/eula/394690_eula_1)
